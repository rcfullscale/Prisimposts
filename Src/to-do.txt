    - rename Prisimposts repo (typo + hard to read. change to e.g. prism-posts) [done]
    - remove "PRISM posts" subfolder (unnecessary directory nesting) [done]
    - delete "index.html.lnk" .. this is a windows short-cut and has no place in the repo [done]
    - either rename "code" folder to e.g. src or remove (unnecessary directory nesting) [done]
    - move *.css/*.js to e.g. /static and *.jpg to e.g. /assets (or keep in same folder but move from root folder) [files delted]
    - rename index.js to e.g. site.js. (calling it "index" implies it's for the main page only, which works at the moment but if you were to add additional pages this no longer makes sense).... the same applies to index.css [done]
- png.jpg ..... really??? ðŸ˜‰   What is it? png or jpg? Also, get an image without a watermark. Call it "background" etc. or even better, be descriptive .... e.g. bg_gray_checker_pattern.jpg
  - dad.jpg ... rename to rodney-pearson-headshot.jpg

- use descriptive css class names, e.g. replace "whatdo" with "company-about" and "dis1" with "description"
  - fix typos (priceing --> pricing)
  - inconsistent, e.g. ph2 vs p1
